## My dotfiles

Mostly nvim / tmux / sway config.

#### Sway stuff

The main template is based on this tutorial: https://www.learnlinux.tv/how-i-set-up-the-sway-window-manager-on-debian-12/

I use Waybar and Wofi for UI, Mako for notifications, and Grim + Slurp for screenshots.

#### Neovim

I write Java, Python and SQL so my Neovim setup is oriented around these languages, but the general template is taken from https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-neovim-2024
